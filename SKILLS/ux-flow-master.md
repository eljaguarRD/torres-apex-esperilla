# SKILL: UX-Flow-Master

## Description
Expertise in creating "Perfect Flows" where the user never feels lost and every action leads to a conversion.

## Principles
1. **The 3-Click Rule**: No critical action should take more than 3 clicks to reach.
2. **Feedback Loops**: Every interaction must have a visual response (hover, loading state, success toast).
3. **Metric-First Design**: Every button or link must be tagged for tracking.
4. **Consistency**: Use the standardized `Nexus-UI` tokens for colors and spacing.

## Checklist for UX
- [ ] Does this page have a single, clear Primary Action (CTA)?
- [ ] Is there a breadcrumb or clear "Back" path?
- [ ] Are we tracking "Time on Page" and "Click-Through Rate" (CTR)?
